# ACL-ActionLearner

## TODO
- Training configs for teacher policies
- Training codes for the student policy
- Checkpoints for teacher policies, encoder, and decoder
- Sim2real suitable for loosing-torque faults manipulation

## ASKING FOR HELP
We’re afraid of damaging the quadruped, so we haven’t tested the standing and hand-standing gaits in real cases yet. We will sincerely appreciate it if someone can share checkpoints/training configs that are tested to be valid for Go2 in real cases for these two gaits!
